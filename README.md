# British Airways Project

This project is my attempt for the Forage Virtual Experience Program offered by British Airways.

The project involved the following:

- Web-scrapping the reviews pertaining to BA and creating a corpus.
- Performing EDA on the customers using the data collected.
- Conducting a sentiment analysis and sharing the results.
- Studying a new customer booking dataset to predict key features responsible for successful ticket booking.
